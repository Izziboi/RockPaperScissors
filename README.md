# RockPaperScissors 
This is the popular Rock-Paper_Scissors game, where you make your choice and the computer also makes its own choice randomly.
The paper wins the rock, the rock wins the scissors and the scissors wins the paper.
It is actually a game of luck, as there is no formular on how to beat the computer. It makes its choice arbitrarily.
As a user, your job is just to click any of the three image options (rock, paper, scissors) and then watch out for the choice of the computer, and of course, the result.
The summary of the results is updated with each round of play of the game.
